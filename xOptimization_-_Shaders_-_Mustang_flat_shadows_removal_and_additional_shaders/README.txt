This mod deactivates the flat shadows of practically all scenery objects (notably trees/forests and buildings) within DCS World, only leaving shadows for own aircraft and surrounding objects such as ground units and other aircraft.
The main benefit to be gained from this is to retain the cockpit shadows while turning off nearly all external shadow sources, this mod is especially useful for VR users who are familiar with having to turn pit shadows off.
To gain the most out of this mod the user should select Terrain Object Shadows as Flat, the other shadow setting in the DCS options can be set to what ever the user desires.
Also included in this package is a tweaked NVG shader for clearer cockpit reading, a modified overcast shader (adjusted luminance levels) and a very popular modification for smoke columns.
One other point to raise is that this mod also affects the 'default' terrain shadows setting as even that renders flat shadows out to a certain distance so even with the 'default' setting there is a benefit to be had. 

Ce mod désactive les ombres plates (Flat Shadows) de DCS (en particulier, les arbres et les batiments, mais pas le terrain).
L'avantage est de pouvoir régler les ombres du terrain sur "Flat", et de les supprimer complètement, tout en gardant des ombres dans le cockpit et autour de l'avion.
